Organization: Makeup My Life

What They Do: Makeup My Life is a fictional organization that provides offsite makeup and style counseling. This would be over Skype, 
  FaceTime, etc.
  
Target Demographic: young-to-middle-aged adults. Given that the service involves makeup, this will be heavily female, but not necessarily
  entirely so. It should be open to all genders. It especially targets those in middle and upper-middle classes who are working and 
  therefore have more important things to dedicate their time and money to than perfecting their makeup, although it may be required
  for self-confidence, image, and/or workplace professionalism.

Easiest Part: The easiest part of this was the design. I've made some websites before so was able to pull some ideas like icon boxes
  and banner images out of my back pocket, and the color scheme appeared in my mind quickly.

Hardest Part: The hardest part was dealing with some of the trickier elements, such as the sticky header and footer, as well as 
  positioning and scaling images.
